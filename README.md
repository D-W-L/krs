krs provides bindings to the key retention service on linux systems. The key retention service offers the opportunity to save data in kernel space, with various kinds of access permissions. This improves security for sensitive data like encryption keys. For a detailed description of the service consult the kernel docs at [https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/security/keys/core.html](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/security/keys/core.html)
